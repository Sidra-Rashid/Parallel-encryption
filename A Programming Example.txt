A Programming Example

Consider a real-time ultrasonic imaging system [GSVOM97], designed to acquire, process and display a tomographic image. Data is acquired based on the reflection of an ultrasonic signal that excites an array of 56 ceramic sensors. Data is amplified and digitalised to form a black and white image of 56´ 256 pixels, each one represented by a byte. An interpolation program is required to process the image, enlarging it to make it clearer to the observer. The image is displayed on a standard resolution monitor (640´ 480 pixels) in real-time, this is, at least 25 frames per second. In accordance with these requirements, an interpolation by a factor 3 between columns was chosen, enlarging the information of each image three times. A calculation shows the volume of data to be processes per second: each frame is represented as 168´ 256´ 1 bytes, and using 25 frames per second, makes a total of 1.075200 Mbytes per second. Using a manager-worker system for the cubic interpolation, the image is received a stream of pixels by the manager, which assigns to each worker a couple of pixels. Each worker uses each couple of pixels as input data, and calculates the cubic interpolation between them, producing other four interpolated pixels. As the number of workers is less than the total number of pixels, each worker requests for more work to the manager as soon as it finishes its process, and so on.
