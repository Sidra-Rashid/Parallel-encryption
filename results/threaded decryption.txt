A
Non-programming
Example

Suppose
a
simple
scheme
for
a
repair
centre,
involving
a
manager
and
a
group
of
technicians.
The
manager
is
responsible
for
receiving
articles,
and
assigning
an
article
to
be
repaired
by
a
technician.
All
technicians
have
similar
skills
for
repairing
articles,
and
each
one
is
responsible
to
repair
one
article
at
a
time,
independent
of
the
other
technicians.
When
a
technician
finishes
repairing
his
assignment,
he
notifies
the
manager;
the
manager
then
assigns
him
a
new
article
to
be
repaired,
and
so
on.
In
general,
repairing
articles
represents
an
irregular
problem:
some
articles
may
present
a
simple
fix
and
take
a
little
amount
of
time,
while
others
may
require
a
more
complex
repair.
Also,
the
effectiveness
of
this
scheme
relies
on
the
fact
that
the
number
of
articles
that
arrive
to
the
centre
can
be
substantially
larger
than
the
number
of
technicians
available.
